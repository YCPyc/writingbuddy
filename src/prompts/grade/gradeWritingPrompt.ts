  {
    "score": "3",
    "rationale": "Your essay is well-organized and presents clear arguments, which is why it falls in category 3. You provide good points about technology's impact on education, jobs, and communication. However, some arguments could be further developed with more specific examples. The writing is mostly clear, though there are some areas where sentence variety and transitions could be improved. Your conclusion effectively summarizes the discussion, but restating the main ideas in a new way would strengthen it. Keep up the good work!"
