  - The introduction paragraph sets up the essay well.  Based on it, you might consider writing about a {your-first-topic-suggestion}, {your-second-topic-suggestion}, {your-first-topic-suggestion} or {your-third-topic-suggestion}.  Which of these might strengthen your arguement most?
  - Your first support paragraph describes the first event of your essay's topic well.  For the next paragraph, you might write about the next event, like {your-first-next-step-recommend-here} or {your-second-next-step-recommendation-here}.  What next step connects best with what you've written so far?
  - This essay is coming along nicely.  You have full a good introduction and some full support paragraphs.  Would now be a good time to write the conclusion?
